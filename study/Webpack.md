# 9 Webpack

## 9.0 Introduction to Webpack

### webpack

- We want to write sexy JavaScript, CSS => Webpack convert sexy codes that browsers cannot understand to traditional boring codes that the browsers can understand.
- webpack bundle scripts into normal JS and CSS
- We usually use tools which already has webpack inside.
- Gulp is an easy alternative for webpack, but not as powerful as webpack

- webpack은 모던 JavaScript 애플리케이션을 위한 정적 모듈 번들러 입니다.
- webpack이 애플리케이션을 처리할 때, 내부적으로는 프로젝트에 필요한 모든 모듈을 매핑하고 하나 이상의 번들을 생성하는 디펜던시 그래프를 만듭니다.
- We don't have to configure webpack most of the time, but we need to know the standard!
